# Detecting-Ecological-Changes-with-Remote-Sensing-based-Ecological-Index-RSEI-
The ecological environment is closely related to human health and human life. With increasing human activities such as urbanization and industrialization there has been 
significant global ecosystem disturbances at various scales. Large-scale ecosystem disturbances have considerable influences on the global carbon cycle and can exacerbate global climate change. The human-induced ecological disturbances exist over different ranges in terms of distances, magnitudes, and durations and thus should be monitored and quantified effectively. There is an increasing need for effective techniques to quantify and detect ecological changes because the change rate of land use and land cover is faster than the self-regulation speed of the ecosystem, which is causing enormous pressure and destruction to the ecological environment.
Recent advances in remote sensing technology have provided a large amount of land surface data for ecosystem monitoring and a robust indication of ecological conditions at different scales. Remote sensing imagery can be used to detect ecological status in various ranges because it measures reflected radiation of the Earthâ€™s surface and hence can detect different components of an ecosystem such as soil, vegetation and open water. Therefore, remote sensing technology has been frequently utilized in ecosystem investigations.
